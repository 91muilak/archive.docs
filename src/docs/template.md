It's very easy to make some words *italic* and other words **bold**.
Any word wrapped with two tildes (like ~~this~~) will appear crossed out.

You can even link to [PaperHive](https://paperhive.org/).

You can structure your texts in the following way:

# Title
## Subtitle
### Another deeper title

You can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different title sizes.

Bullet list:
* Start a line with an asterisk
* Food
  * Fruits
    * Oranges
    * Apples

Numbered list:
1. One
2. Two
3. Three

A horizontal line looks like this:

---
This is text.

If you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:

> This is a blockquote.
>
> This is the second paragraph.

If you want to insert images, this is how you do it:

If you have inline code blocks, you can wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`.

If you've got a longer block of code, you can use ```:

``` js
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```
